# RemoteEvents
*I'll make a remoteEvent fire command that fires a table, which gets unpacked later on and each arg fired in order of table.*
before using, make a variable thats the argument, so it actually fires.

`flint.FireRemoteEvent([remoteeventtofire], [arg to fire])`

Works by taking the remoteEvent, then firing it with the variable you've put in the function arguments.
