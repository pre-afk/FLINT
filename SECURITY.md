# Security Policy

When a red X (:x:) is next to the version you are using, it means the version of the script has bugs and security vulnerabilities, like getting patched by antivirus or scripts not working properly due to many factors, like Roblox Updating and my scripting.

When the version has a green check (:white_check_mark:) it's save to use and no reported bugs or vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :x:   Known bugs   |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, go to the issues tab and open a issue. I'll get to it as soon as I see it.
